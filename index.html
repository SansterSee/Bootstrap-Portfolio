        <p>
            Born in Taipei, Taiwan. My family and I immigrated to the United States when I was six-years-old.
            I was able to further my Chinese language skills through self-learning and became a Chinese linguist for the US Army, eventually rising to the position of expert Chinese linguist in the private sector.

        <p>
            Seeking a new challenge, I decided to learn a completely different language: computer coding. It is my hope that I can become fluent in this form of communication as well and earn the bragging right of being able to communicate with both man and machine.
